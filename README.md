# React Notes-Taking App
Welcome to the React Notes-Taking App! This repository contains a simple web application for taking and managing notes using React.<br/>

The **App.jsx** file is a central component of my React application. It serves as the root component that manages the state and rendering of my notes-taking app. Here's an overview of its functionality:
- State Management: The **useState** hook from React is used to manage the notes state. It initializes an empty array to store notes.
- addNote Function: This function is responsible for adding a new note to the notes state array. It takes a newNote as a parameter and uses the **spread operator**(...) to create a new array that includes the previous notes along with the new one.
- deleteNote Function: This function is used to delete a note based on its id. It filters the notes array to exclude the note with the specified id.
- Rendering: This component renders several child components:
  - <Header />: The application's header.
  - <CreateArea />: A component responsible for creating new notes. It calls the addNote function to add new notes to the state.
  - {notes.map()}: A dynamic rendering of Note components based on the notes in the notes array. Each Note component displays a note's title and content and          allows for deletion.
  - <Footer />: The application's footer.
  
- Passing Data: The **addNote** and **deleteNote** functions are passed down to child components to allow for data manipulation from within those components.

This App component acts as the core of my notes-taking app, managing the creation, deletion, and rendering of notes. It demonstrates the use of React hooks and state to build a dynamic user interface.
